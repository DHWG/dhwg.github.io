Welcome to the first post about the DH Beer brewing adventure. We came up with the idea of brewing our own DH beer by ourselves. When we started this journey we had no plan about brewing. We didn’t want to use pre assembled sets like <a href="https://www.braufaesschen.com">braufässchen</a>.
![Beer in our Basement](/images/brewing/beerInBasement.jpg =250x) This was somehow what we aimed for a super homemade beer we could say we did ourselves (more on that part later) and be proud of.
