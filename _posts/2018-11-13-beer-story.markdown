Welcome to the first post about the DH Beer brewing adventure. We came up with the idea of brewing our own DH beer by ourselves. When we started this journey we had no plan about brewing. We didn’t want to use pre assembled sets like <a href="https://www.braufaesschen.com">braufässchen</a>.

This was somehow what we aimed for a homemade beer we brewed ourselves(more on that part later) and be proud of.
