Welcome to the first post about the DH Beer brewing adventure. We came up with the idea of brewing our own DH beer by ourselves. When we started this journey we had no plan about brewing. We didn’t want to use pre assembled sets like <a href="https://www.braufaesschen.com">braufässchen</a>.

This was somehow what we aimed for a homemade beer we brewed ourselves(more on that part later) and be proud of.


## Literature

There are some youtube videos that may help some people but we didn't really like them. It was however somehow inspiring to listen to people bubble for 30 minutes about how to do the mash correctly.

A good resource for reading up how to brew beer is a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/3418008062/ref=asc_df_341800806256837420/?tag=googshopde-21&creative=22398&creativeASIN=3418008062&linkCode=df0&hvadid=310638342202&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13155035818378989475&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9042426&hvtargid=pla-564148427400&th=1&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=64643860067&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=310638342202&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13155035818378989475&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9042426&hvtargid=pla-564148427400"> "Heimbrauen - Schritt für Schritt zum eigenen Bier"</a>.

## Ingredients

Let's start with the Ingredients. Traditional german beer is made out of four different ingredients: Water, malt, hop and yeast. 

#### Water 
is easy in germany we can just use tab water. The only problem is that tab water can have a high amount of chalk in it that is why we poured our water through one of those water filter systems to get some of the chalk out.

#### Malt
we had no clue but malt is a sort of grain that starts sprouting. This process apperantly creates enzymes that are important for brewing beer. After that the malt is desiccated and after that its beeing grounded.

#### Hop
is responsible for the biterness in the beer. It's very healthy and is the reason for the proverb "Pils instead of pills". After harvesting hop is beeing dried and is pressed into little pellets that can be directly used for brewing. 

#### Yeast
Yeast is a special kind of fungus and creates the fermentation of the beer. It converts the sugar of the malt into ethanol and carbon dioxide. So yeast and malt create the alkohol and the bubbles of a beer.
